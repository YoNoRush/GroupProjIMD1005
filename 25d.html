            <h3>What makes it unique?</h3>

            <p class="explanation">
                2.5D it quite a new form of animation. It fuses elements of 2D and 3D to create a whole
                new medium of animation. Many movie and videogame producers have used elements of both 2D and 3D 
                to generate media, such as Spiderman: Into (and Across) The Spiderverse, which uses a 3D environment
                to tell its story in a modern way whilst using many elements of 2D (such as cell shading and halftones)
                to keep the 2D style of comics which inspired the film's creation. <br> <br>
                There are as of now 2 ways of creating 2.5D shows, movies and videogames; they either start out
                in a 3D environment and add 2D elements along the way, or, like for the creation of the movie Klaus
                by Netflix, they start out with traditional 2D animation and add lighting effects to make it look 3D.

            <h3>What makes it appealing?</h3>

            <p class="explanation">
            There are many people who prefer 2D animation as opposed to 3D and vice versa. The older generation
            generally likes to view movies that are 2D since it's nostalgic and it's what they're used to, however
            the newer generation however grew up watching and playing 3D media, so it was only a matter of time 
            that a new form of media, which combines both forms and appeals to both audiences, was created. <br> <br>
            
            Not only can 2.5D animations piggyback off other medias, which already have a huge fanbase like animes 
            and comic books, to create more modern and innovative movies, but they can also be in many styles; cartoony, 
            anime, traditional, realism, and so much more, which appeals to a wide range of audiences.
