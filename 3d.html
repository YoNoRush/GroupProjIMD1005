Finding its roots in stop-motion, where models (often made of clay) were meticulously posed and moved by hand, 3D animation quickly evolved upon the dawn of powerful workstation computers.<br><br>Now, 3D is used almost everywhere - CGI in live action films, cutscenes in games, 3D animated films, and even in some cases as a tool in traditional animation as well.</p>

            <p>One of the most beloved forms of animation comes in the form of stop-motion. While less popular in modern media, it is nonetheless <span class="highlight">the pioneer of 3D animation.</span> Animators would, typically, craft and move clay models, taking a snapshot of each frame as they did so.<br><br>A meticulous form of animation, stop-motion required the animator to create natural movement whilst avoiding causing any disruptions in the scene or camera that would be immediately apparent on film. Unlike modern animation techniques, there was generally no form of onion-skinning or any way to preview previous frames - making natural movement much harder to achieve.<br><br><span class="highlight">Stop motion has a recognizable human touch to it,</span> giving it a unique feel that is usually unreplicated by other forms of animation. One of the most popular stop-motion films is Wallace and Gromit, featured right.</p>

By the 1980s, personal computers such as the Amiga were capable of creating ray-casted 3D renders, as shown.<br><br>In 1995, the first feature length film using entirely 3D animation, Toy Story, was released. <span class="highlight">This marked a turning point in computer graphics animation</span> - it had previously been used for CGI in live action films and short films.<br><br>By the late 90s, multiple studios were racing each other (and themselves) to create new films and improve on CG technology.</p>
